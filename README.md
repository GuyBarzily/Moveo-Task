Hi, This is my home assignment for Moveo Group.

code blocks solutions:

1. Async Arrow Function : const as = async () =>{}
2. Set Timeout : setTimeout(code, delay)
3. Print 1 to 10 using for loop : for (len i = 1; i < 11; i++){console.log(i);}
4. print 1 to 10 using while loop : 'let i = 1;
   while (i<11){console.log(i);}'
